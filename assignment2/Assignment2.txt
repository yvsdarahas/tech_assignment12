- Exchange Rate Challenge
This task is about a simulation of the conversion rate of currencies.

Time estimated: 1 Day

Description:
- You may use your development environment to your convenience, your
  workstation, IDE, setup, tooling, internet etc.
- You may implement it using any scripting or development language of your
  preference ( Python preferred).
- You may use any libraries that will make your code cleaner, or better in any
  way.

The task has 3 steps. Please complete the phases one by one.

Step 1: 
1.1 Search the web for a USD EUR exchange rate API. ( Suggested:
https://www.freeforexapi.com/api/live?pairs=USDEUR )
1.2 Sample this source for the latest USD to EUR exchange value every 5
seconds and print to the screen for 1 minute.
- Expected output: Python/Other script that will call the API, read the value
  and print it to the screen every 5 seconds for 1 minute.

Step 2:
2.1 Compute the average value over the last 60 seconds.
2.2 Write the average value to a log file.
2.3 Fine tune the code - optimize, rewrite etc. ( for example use flask8,
black in python)
- Expected output: Expand the script from Step 1 with the above tasks and
  optimize the code to the extent possible.

  Step 3: 
3.1 Write a Dockerfile to run the above mentioned application/script with all
the necessary dependencies. ( in Ubuntu)
3.2 Run the Docker Container and show that the log file was produced. 
3.3 Fine tune the Dockerfile with all the best practices. 
- Expected output: A Dockerfile and a corresponding docker image that should
  be able to start the script from Step 2 and produce the log file.

Deliverables:
- Dockerfile 
- Docker image - which will include also the python script. 

Upload the above files on a online drive of your choice and share the link to
it.
